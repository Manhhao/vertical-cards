# Vertical Cards

A lovely card template for Anki that I've made for my Yomitan dictionaries. Grand for studying on any device!

## Have a quick look!

*[GIF demonstrating responsive layout and features will go here]*

- **Smart layout that adapts to your screen**: 
  - Flips horizontal when you're on your mobile or have a narrow window open
  
- **Plays nicely with dictionaries**:
  - Definitions are cyclable
  - Styling support for my converted Yomitan dictionaries.
  - Collapsible sections for some dictionaries so you're not overwhelmed with text

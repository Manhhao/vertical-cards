# Vertical Cards

A lovely card template for Anki that I've made for my Yomitan dictionaries <img src="assets/SaberLion.png" width="20" height="20" alt="SaberLion" />. Grand for studying on any device! 

## How it looks

### Desktop

### Mobile
![Mobile Horizontal Layout](./assets/mobile.jpg)

- **Smart layout that adapts to your screen**: 
  - Flips horizontal when you're on your mobile or have a narrow window open
  
- **Plays nicely with dictionaries**:
  - Definitions and images are cyclable
  - Styling support for my converted Yomitan dictionaries and some others too.
  - Collapsible sections for some dictionaries

### Yomitan fields
